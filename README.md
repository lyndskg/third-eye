1. Prompts user(s) to record new and/or use existing vocal profiles — defaulting to user’s previously configured option(s), or to profile creation.
2. Using machine learning techniques, declares and defines discrete vocal profile of any new user(s) — self-enhancing and training model based on OG sample vocal output supplied by user(s) after being prompted. 
3. Based on vocal profiles both trained specifically using the buzzword and/or 

triggered/started/activated 
1. Listens for buzzword. 
2. Upon hearing buzzword, ™️ activates user/starter/activator/runner’s PC’s built-in and/or externally pre-configured microphone.
3. ™️ begins recording audio (and preferably also video, if possible).
- Note 1: If the PC’s screen is off and/or if the device is asleep, check to see if it possible to
    - If it possible, decide whether or not to start running its executable — based on pre-configured options previously prompted to (and hence, subsequently set by) the user. 
    - If it is not, give option(s) to user to pre-configure.
        - WARNING: This is going to be hard!! 
        - By default, each time it is ran, ™️ “self-destructs” the specific respectively-generated instance of its program.
        - However, more significantly, ™️ “deletes” (or at the very least, hides/obfuscates) its very binary presence — in the eyes of every and/or any person except ™️’s user.
- Note 2: If possible, gives user option(s) to use native VM environment(s) (e.g. macOS) software apps, and/or its’ (or others’) local configs / settings.
- if not, also gives rationale explaining standpoint(s) from official, technical, and/or otherwise objective / extremely widely divisive: 
    - why it is or isn’t from official, technical, and/or otherwise objective standpoint(s), and/or 
    - why it is actually and/or technically impossible/realizable/feasible/reasonable
 as a programmer to do so  
6. Stores recorded audio and/or video in a file location knowable and/or retrievable-findable only to user. 
7. Essentially sublimates insofar as its’ automatic self-triggering and execution(s) of self-destructive/deleterious action(s) that either try to:
    1. delete themselves (and/or otherwise are literally self-destructive — as agreed upon by most and/or by any reasonable definition), and/or 
    2. hide themselves (and/or otherwise obfuscate)
        and conceal any previous, current, and/or  scheduled runtime instances from any and/or every person but the user.
- Involves cessation of any active runtime(s) of all their corresponding pre-specified executable(s), as well as deletion or obfuscation of any and/or every trace of the aforementioned runtime(s), and technically/perceptually, their very binary existence in time and/or space — in any measurable state(s) or combination of such. 
    - i.e.: Until its absolute termination, destroy any and every trace of its effective footprint on the entire PC — including, but not limited to
        - historical data (e.g. quantitative statistics on usage since its DOB, logs of obsolete settings and/or configurations previously supplied and/or also used in previous instances of the program by the user), and/or 
        - current session configuration data, such as 
            - low-level software settings (e.g. compilation process settings), and/or
        - any potentially sensitive, user-specific configuration settings/data left behind at any time, captured as 
            - default settings/configurations previously set and either intentionally or automatically cached by the user, and 
            - a comprehensive configuration profile for each explicit yet virtually identical process that had ever existed — and was ever used by and/or for the program, in which case 
            - BLAHHH……
        - metadata (e.g. web cookies), and/or
        - historical session configuration(s), and/or
        - anything else that can be remotely traced back to both the very existence and historical and/or current processes of the program ran on the PC. 
             both perceptually and technically as not only a runtime instance, but also a computational state. 
- “self-destruction” scripts deleterious to its for its specific runtime instance,
